# Utilities for React and RxJS 6

This package provides simple helpers for mixing React with RxJS 6.

**NOTICE: for most use cases, you will probably be better served using the RxJS functions of [recompose]. I built this package to have a better support of RxJS 6 with TypeScript: unless you have faced the same issues, `react-rxjs-utils` might not be the best option.**

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install react-rxjs-utils
```

### Usage

TBD
